A library for modelizing D&amp;D data

This library uses the Entity Framework to modelize the data contained in the D&D rulebooks as closely as possible. There are still many cases where I have to denormalize the database to make it usable...

Based on D&D 3.5 data. I'm focusing on the Player's Handbook only as of now. 

The project is still at a very early stage of development, expect many bugs, bogus data and breaking changes !
